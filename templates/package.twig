    <p>
        We're committed to creating a unique environment where folks get to share their
        experience and knowledge with others for our combined growth and benefit. CampJS
        has hosted a broad range of speakers in the last previous 6 events, and we hope to
        repeat this again at CampJS VII.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the help of sponsors, we are able to to assist with travel costs and conference
      attendance for a limited number of speakers, so please let us know if this is something
      that makes it possible for you to attend where you would otherwise be unable.  We'll see
      what we can do.
    </p>
    <p>
        International speakers are encouraged to <a href="/">submit their ideas</a>, but because of budget restrictions,
        we can only accept a limited number of speakers from outside the country.
    </p>
    <h4 class="headline--alpha">Tips for Submission</h4>
    <p>
        We <i>strongly</i> encourage potential speakers to submit more than one submission on more than one topic. The
        more submissions you contribute, the more options you give us to pick you. Be sure your talk title and abstract
        define the exact topic you want to talk about and what you hope people will learn from the session. In previous
        years, some submissions sounded interesting but we just didn't have enough detail for them to make the final cut.
